                    <h6>Spin-Twril-Repeat!</h6>
                    <p>Dancing has always been a deep passion for me, even though I haven't had formal professional training. Whenever I had an opportunity to perform, I never shy away from it. During my childhood, I didn't have access to the proper facilities or structured lessons to develop my skills, but that never dampened my enthusiasm. I was always the first to step forward and perform at school and college events, embracing every chance to showcase my love for dance. One of my most memorable experiences was performing on a grand stage at IIT Madras during INTER IIT CULTURAL MEET 5.0. It was an enriching journey where I not only expanded my repertoire by learning new techniques and dance forms but also gained valuable insights from other performers. No matter what direction life takes me, dance will forever remain an integral part of who I am.</p>

                    <h6>Reel-Comfort!</h6>
                    <p>I have a special fondness for movies that beautifully portray family relationships. While they don’t always evoke strong emotions in me, there’s an undeniable sense of comfort that comes with watching these heartfelt stories unfold. I’m particularly drawn to films set in village landscapes, where the simplicity of life, rich traditions, and serene rural backdrops shine through. The presence of soothing background music is a must, as it adds a layer of tranquility to the experience.

                        In addition, I enjoy historical mystery movies, especially those with a hint of devotion intertwined, offering a blend of intrigue and cultural depth. There's also something incredibly relatable about "next-door" stories—those everyday tales that resonate deeply. Whenever I feel disconnected or need to unwind, I turn to these comfort movies from my personal collection, finding solace and joy in familiar narratives.</p>
